The Iyzipay CLI provides a suite of tools to speed up your development workflow.

## General Usage

All commands use the `iyzi` prefix. You can see the list of available commands by running:

```bash
npx iyzi --help
```

---

## `iyzi init`

Initializes the project configuration. This command creates a `.env` file (if it doesn't exist) and helps you populate it with your API keys.

<Steps>
<Step>
 ### Run the command
 
 ```bash
 npx iyzi init
 ```
</Step>

 ### Enter Credentials
 
 It will ask for your **API Key** and **Secret Key**. You can find these in your [Iyzico Sandbox Account](https://sandbox-iyzipay.com).
</Step>
<Step>

## `iyzi whoami`

Checks the current environment configuration and connectivity.

```bash
npx iyzi whoami
```

**Output:**
- **Environment**: Sandbox or Production.
- **Masked Credentials**: Shows part of your API key for verification.
- **Latency**: Pings the Iyzico API to check response time.

## `iyzi pay`

Creates a test payment instantly. It's the fastest way to verify that your whole integration pipeline (keys + network) is working.

```bash
npx iyzi pay
```

It uses a hardcoded test card (Garanti Bonus) and a random basket item to perform a `payment.create` operation.

---

## `iyzi cards`

An interactive wizard to find and copy test card numbers. No need to browse documentation pages to find a specific test card.

```bash
npx iyzi cards
```

<Tabs items={['Success Scenarios', 'Error Scenarios']}>
  <Tab value="Success Scenarios">
    Select from a list of valid cards:
    - Garanti Debit (MasterCard)
    - Akbank Credit (MasterCard)
    - IsBankasi Credit (Visa)
    - Foreign Credit Cards
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Error Scenarios">
    Test specific error codes easily:
    - Insufficient Funds (Error 10051)
    - Stolen Card (Error 10043)
    - Expired Card (Error 10054)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The selected card number is automatically **copied to your clipboard**.

---

## `iyzi check`

Retrieves installment options for a specific price and credit card BIN (first 6 digits).

```bash
npx iyzi check <price> --bin <binNumber>
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<price>` | The amount to query installments for (e.g. `100`). |
| `--bin, -b` | The first 6 digits of the credit card. |

**Example:**

```bash
# Check installments for 1500 TRY on a card starting with 552608
npx iyzi check 1500 -b 552608
```

It displays a neat table of available installment plans, total prices, and per-month costs.

---

## `iyzi generate`

Scaffolds UI components for your project. Currently supports generating a **Payment Form**.

```bash
npx iyzi generate
```

The CLI will ask you for:
1. **Component Type**: e.g., Checkout Form.
2. **Style**:
    - **Shadcn UI**: Uses generic `components/ui` structure (Zod + React Hook Form).
    - **Tailwind CSS**: Pure HTML/CSS with Tailwind classes (headless).

<Callout type="warn">
  This command assumes you have a `components` directory. It will create `components/iyzipay-ui/payment-form.tsx`.
</Callout>
