The **Iyzipay CLI** is designed to improve your Developer Experience (DX) when working with Iyzico payments. It allows you to test connections, manage API keys, and scaffold components directly from your terminal.

## Installation

You don't need to install the CLI globally. You can run it directly using your package manager's execute command (like `npx` or `pnpx`).

However, you can also add it to your project:

```package-install
npm install iyzipay-node-ts
```

## Quick Start

Run the help command to see available options:

```bash
npx iyzi --help
```
